        This is an academic experiment on economic decision-making. To participate, you must be between <strong>18 and 60 years old.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Participant fee made bold (14.08.2025) by Mohd Uwaish-->
        As a participant, you will engage in a virtual market, making economic decisions related to a virtual good. Completing the entire experiment will take approximately 45 minutes. The base reward for participation is <strong> {{ participation_fee }} </strong>, with a large portion paid as a bonus based on your decisions. Participation is voluntary; if you choose to withdraw, you will forfeit payment. To avoid delays, bonus payments will be made a few days after all participants have completed the experiment.

    <h2>Termination Rule</h2>
    <p>
        If a participant chooses to leave the room early, the experiment will end immediately, and only the show-up fee will be provided to that individual. However, the remaining participants will receive full compensation for their time. We strongly encourage all participants to stay until the end, as your full participation is essential for the studyâ€™s success and for ensuring fair compensation for everyone involved.

    <h2><strong>Setup Requirements</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>To participate in the experiment, you must:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use a laptop with a working front camera</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sit at a desk</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Be alone in a quiet room</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <div style="background-color: #fff8e1; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <p><strong>Camera & Lighting:</strong><br>
        Please ensure your face is clearly visible to the camera by using sufficient and appropriate lighting. If you are near a window or natural light source, sit facing the light rather than having it behind you. If you're in a room without natural light, make sure the lighting is positioned in a way that illuminates your face. You can quickly test this using your front camera before continuing with the experiment.</p>

            If you are unable to meet the setup requirements at the time of participation, we kindly ask you to close the page and withdraw from the experiment. Please note that compensation can only be provided if all required conditions are met and the study is completed as instructed
